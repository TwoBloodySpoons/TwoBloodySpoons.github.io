today i converted my django blog to jekyll. here's why and how i did it.

## why jekyll?

- static site generation
- github pages integration
- markdown-based content
- simpler deployment

## the process

1. created `_config.yml` with site configuration
2. converted django templates to jekyll layouts
3. set up github actions for automatic building
4. migrated styling to maintain the dracula theme

the result is a faster, simpler blog that's easier to maintain.
